      <p class="w3-justify">To celebrate the start of the new academic year, the Bath Student Chapter is organising an event based on the Channel 4 gameshow, Countdown! Unleash your inner Rachel Riley in this group based number crunching activity. Free pizzas will be provided, and groups will be decided on the day. Please sign-up for this event by filling out the following <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfor4QOZvgXJZGKLoUoaD8Qmi_du3tKxkYxCGmxFQ1Ggcn8Mw/viewform?usp=sf_link"><b>Google Form</b></a>. We hope to see you there! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psTWD4oL2yM">Here</a> is an example of what the game looks like from the show for those who don't know (we hope you've brushed up on your 13 times tables!).</p>
