We hope to see you there! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psTWD4oL2yM">Here</a> is an example of what the game looks like from the show for those who don't know (we hope you've brushed up on your 13 times tables!).</p>

      <p class="w3-justify"> Our next event is going to be our "Thesis in Pi" competition. The aim of the competition is for the contestants to give an elevator pitch of their research. The contest is open to all post-graduate students who have conducted some original research upon which they can base their talk, and have used maths in their research in some way. The goal is to explain your research to a non-specialist audience, in a short and accessible way. </p>
      <br>
      <p class="w3-justify">The rules are as follows: </p>
        <ol class="w3-justify" type="1">
          <li>You have exactly 3:14 minutes to present your research</li>
          <li>It must be your own research (collaborative work is allowed)</li>
          <li>You are only allowed a single static slide (no GIFs or other visual aids, e.g. use of chalkboard, or physical demonstrations)</li>
          <li>You must speak live (no pre-recordings).</li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <p class="w3-justify"></p>Beyond these rules we encourage you to get as creative as you want with your presentation! You will be scored on the three C’s: Content; Clarity; and Charisma. There will be a PRIZE for best talk, as well as catering after the event.
